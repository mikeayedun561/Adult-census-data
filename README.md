Data science project on predicting one's income based on social factors

Motivation:
I wanted to find which groups were likely to make over 50k based on factors such as education,marital-status, and occupation. Goal was to make a model which will predict this based on these social factors.

outcome:
I created a model which predicted the probability of belong to the class of making over 50k. I found that the groups most like to make over 50k often had a bachelors. Also people with bachelors tended to have less of a capital loss compared to other advanced degrees.My model could use improving and I am considering implement Naive Bayes classifier as a base for my model to improve my models performance.
